Are you trying to see if your favorite movie or tv show is hosted for free online? Well, you've come to the right place! (sorry, very corny)

actually, this is my work-in-progress. Right now the only thing that works is the searching functionality. I'm using fmovies site to do so.
i'm planning to turn this into a flask application alongside HTML, and make a nice user-interface for it.

my purpose for doing so? to be quite honest with you, i'm tired of all these sites profiting off of what they don't own.
i instead intend to make them no money. I would like to use their platform, my way, and bypass all of their ads.

eventually, it will be sick. I'll end up scraping all their images, etc, and making a site thats quite frankly, better than theirs.
